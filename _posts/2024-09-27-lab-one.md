## task 1
For the first task of calculating the average HP of all Digimon, I started with a list to hold all the HP values of each Digimon from the csv file. 

~~~
import csv
with open("digimon.csv", "r") as f:
   data = csv.DictReader(f)
   HP = []
~~~

Then I created an if statement to add all the existing HP values to the list I just created. After this, I created a variable called average which would calculate the average of all the HP values. Once this was finished, all I needed to do was print the results from average to get the average HP of all Digimon. The result was approximately 1210.88

~~~
import csv
with open("digimon.csv", "r") as f:
   data = csv.DictReader(f)
   HP = []
   for row in data:
       if row["HP"] is not None:
           HP.append(int(row["HP"]))
       average = sum(HP) / len(HP)
   print(average)
~~~


## task 2
For the second task of counting the number of Digimon with a specific attribute given by the user, I started by creating code to count the number of Digimon with attributes that I chose. 
~~~
def count_digimon(key, value):
   count = 0
  
   with open("digimon.csv", "r") as f:
       data = csv.DictReader(f)

       for row in data:
           if row["Type"] == "Free":
               count += 1
   return count

result = count_digimon("Type","Free")
print(result)
~~~

This allowed me to visualize how I wanted this code to work. I replaced "Type" amd "Free" with the parameters from count_digimon to allow for the user to choose what they wanted to count. I also created a way to let me know if there were any errors with finding the file or if the key the user chose didn't exist. The code looked like this, but I still had trouble figuring out how to execute it without having to manually type it out in python. 

~~~
import csv

def count_digimon(key, value):
    count = 0
    key_input = []
    value_input = []
    count_list = []

    with open("digimon.csv", "r") as f:
        data = csv.DictReader(f)

        for row in data:
            if row[key] not in key_input:
                key_input.append(row[key])

            if value not in value_input:
                value_input.append(value)

            if row.get(key) == value:
                count += 1
                count_list.append(count)
        
    return count
~~~

After consulting https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-name 

to figure out how I was going to get input from the user without using the terminal to run the code, I found "__name__" and "__main__". Using name and main in the code allowed me to make sure that the counting in the function only ran when I opened the script and made it easier to test the counting for different keys and values without having additional code or possible spelling errors when running it in python. 

~~~
if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_key = input("Key:")
    user_value = input("Value:")

    result = count_digimon(user_key, user_value)
    print(f"Count of Digimon with {user_key} '{user_value}': {result}")
~~~

I also realized that having count as a list was unnecessary for the code and wasnt being used. After deleting that, the code was finally finished and was able to take keys and values from the user to count the Digimons with those values. This was the finished code:

~~~
import csv

def count_digimon(key, value):
    count = 0
    key_input = []
    value_input = []

    with open("digimon.csv", "r") as f:
        data = csv.DictReader(f)

        for row in data:
            if row[key] not in key_input:
                key_input.append(row[key])

            if row.get(key) not in value_input:
                value_input.append(row.get(key))

            if row.get(key) == value:
                count += 1
    return count

if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_key = input("Key:")
    user_value = input("Value:")

    result = count_digimon(user_key, user_value)
    print(f"Count of Digimon with {user_key} '{user_value}': {result}")
~~~

## task 3

For task 3 to find a team of Digimons with a combined memory less than or equal to 15 and combined attack of 300 or more than 300, I started by creating a list called digimon_data to hold the digimons that would make up the possible teams. 

~~~
import csv 

def digimons():
    digimon_data = []

    with open("digimon.csv", "r") as f:
        data = csv.DictReader(f)

        for row in data:
            digimon_data.append(row)

    return digimon_data
~~~

After this, I created a function called teams to read from digimon_data and check out different combinations of digimons in a team to see if their memory and attack would fufill the task's requirements. In teams, I created an empty list called possible_teams to store the valid teams of the Digimons and used nested loops which allowed me to iterate through the possible combinations of the 3 digimon (digi_1, digi_2, and digi_3). The values team_memory and team_attack allowed me to calculate the total memory and attack power of the digimons and checked if the total values fufilled the requirements of the task. 

~~~
def teams(digimon_data):
    possible_teams = []
    length = len(digimon_data)

    for digi_1 in range(length):
        for digi_2 in range(digi_1 + 1, length):
            for digi_3 in range(digi_2 + 1, length):
                team_memory = (int(digimon_data[digi_1]["Memory"]) + 
                               int(digimon_data[digi_2]["Memory"]) +
                               int(digimon_data[digi_3]["Memory"]))
                team_attack = (int(digimon_data[digi_1]["Atk"]) +
                               int(digimon_data[digi_2]["Atk"]) +
                               int(digimon_data[digi_3]["Atk"]))
                
                if team_memory <= 15 and team_attack >= 300:
                    possible_teams.append([digimon_data[digi_1], digimon_data[digi_2], digimon_data[digi_3]])

    return possible_teams
~~~

Lastly, similar to the issue I ran into in task 2, I had to execute the code. I called the digimon function that I created in the begining and checked if the data existed. If the teams existed, I created the variable final_team which called the teams function I created earlier and used the retreived digimon data to find valid combinations of the teams. My biggest struggle in this execution was finding how to print the names of the digimons in the team. With help from https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions 
I was able to iterate through each team in final_teams and print the digimon number (or name) in the possible teams. Lastly, as a precaution I made else statements just incase some part of the lists or iteration went wrong. This was the execution I created:
~~~
#executing the code
digimon_data = digimons()
if digimon_data:
    final_team = teams(digimon_data)
    if final_team:
        for i in final_team:
            print("Final team is:", [d["Number"] for d in i])
    else:
        ("no valid team")
else:
    print("no data")
~~~

One issue with this code is that it doesn't print out one possible team, but rather prints every single possible team which runs a lot of unnecessary code. However, I am okay with this because before this was the output, the code ran infinitely because in my teams function I had created previously (not shown on this blog post), I allowed digi_1/digi_2/digi_3 to equal digi_1/digi_2/digi_3. I fixed this problem by including digi_1 + 1, length in the range instead of just length. The final, executable code looks like this:

~~~
import csv 

def digimons():
    digimon_data = []

    with open("digimon.csv", "r") as f:
        data = csv.DictReader(f)

        for row in data:
            digimon_data.append(row)

    return digimon_data

def teams(digimon_data):
    possible_teams = []
    length = len(digimon_data)

    for digi_1 in range(length):
        for digi_2 in range(digi_1 + 1, length):
            for digi_3 in range(digi_2 + 1, length):
                team_memory = (int(digimon_data[digi_1]["Memory"]) + 
                               int(digimon_data[digi_2]["Memory"]) +
                               int(digimon_data[digi_3]["Memory"]))
                team_attack = (int(digimon_data[digi_1]["Atk"]) +
                               int(digimon_data[digi_2]["Atk"]) +
                               int(digimon_data[digi_3]["Atk"]))
                
                if team_memory <= 15 and team_attack >= 300:
                    possible_teams.append([digimon_data[digi_1], digimon_data[digi_2], digimon_data[digi_3]])

    return possible_teams

#executing the code
digimon_data = digimons()
if digimon_data:
    final_team = teams(digimon_data)
    if final_team:
        for i in final_team:
            print("Final team is:", [d["Number"] for d in i])
    else:
        ("no valid team")
else:
    print("no data")
